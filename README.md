# BoboBot
Personal Discord Bot

This bot is a project to teach myself Python. I knew zero Python when i started, so there is likely quite a bit of bad code in here. I'm continuing to update as I learn.

## Features
### Imgur Cog
The Imgur cog allows for creation of commands that will select a random photo from an imgurt album and post the link back to the channel.

### Purge Cog
The Purge cog allows you to configure a channel to automatically purge messages older than the specified age, from 1 minute to 14 days (the maximum allowed for bots by the Discord API).

### Timebomb Cog
The Timebomb cog allows users to create messages (both text and images) that auto-delete after the specified time, from 1 minute to 14 days (the maximum allowed for bots by the Discord API).

### Spoiler Cog
The Spoiler Cog allows users to spoiler a message or image without needing to remember Discord's spoiler syntax or arcane process for adding spoilers to images.

### Stats Cog
The Stats cog is a small utility cog. Currently it only returns the total number of members joined to the server, but I may add more functionality in the future.

### D&D 5e XP Tracker Cog
The 5e XP cog is a system for tracking D&D 5e experience for a party using [Sherlock Humlmes XP system](https://twitter.com/sherlock_hulmes/status/1226204045397962752).

### Member Channel Cog
The Member Channel cog allows each server member to create a channel of their own, which is meant to be their own space to do with as they please (within the rules of the server). These channels are added to their own "Member Channels" category (or categories, since Discord categories are limited to 50 channels each). This is only reccommended for small community servers with less than a hundred active members.
